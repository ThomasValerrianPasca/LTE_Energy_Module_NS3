# LTE Energy Module in NS3

LTE Energy module is intended to provide a close real time power expenditure of LTE interface in a User Equipment. This makes researches to develop their things solutions with energy module for power optimized proposals.

## LTE UE Energy Module in NS3

It has been considered that LTE power model developed by authors "A. R. Jensen, M. Lauridsen, P. Mogensen, T. B. Srensen, and P. Jensen" in research publication "LTE UE power consumption model: For system level energy and perfor- mance optimization" as a base model for this NS3 energy module. This work is published in "Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall), 2012 IEEE". Power Spent on idle time, Transmission, Reception and combined transmission and reception are counted. Unlinke Wi-Fi which can stay in one state at a time, LTE can be doing transmission and reception.
